Standardization is a core preprocessing technique in data science and machine learning, used to scale features for optimal model performance by transforming them to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.​

What Is Standardization?
Standardization (or Z-score normalization) is the process of rescaling the distribution of values so that the mean of observed values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 for each feature.​


Why Standardization Matters
It ensures all features contribute equally, preventing features with large values from dominating model training.​

Many algorithms—such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), and those using gradient descent—require the data to be scaled to avoid bias and convergence issues.​

Unlike normalization, which rescales data to a specific range (often ), standardization preserves outliers and is not bounded, making it more robust for algorithms expecting Gaussian-like data.​​

Steps to Standardize Data
Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature.

Transform each value: Subtract the mean, divide by the standard deviation for that feature.​

Use libraries: In Python, leverage sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler or scipy.stats.zscore for fast, reliable standardization.​

Python Example (with Pandas and scikit-learn)
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'col1': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
    'col2': [7, 4, 35, 14, 56]
})

scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
print(df_scaled)
Or, using Pandas directly:

python
df['col1'] = (df['col1'] - df['col1'].mean()) / df['col1'].std()
Standardization vs. Normalization
Aspect	Standardization	Normalization


Output range	Centered at 0, SD = 1 ([-∞, ∞])	Typically ​ or [-1, 1]
Outlier effect	Preserves outliers	Sensitive to outliers
Use Case	Distance-based, PCA/SVM/KNN, Gaussian	Neural Nets, bounded-input algorithms
​		
Best Practices & Notes
Fit the scaler only on training data, then transform both train and test splits to avoid data leakage.​

Standardization is generally not needed for tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) as they are insensitive to the scale of features.​

Visualize distributions before and after to confirm transformation effects.
